## Comprehensive Data Science Projects

### What Makes Super Bowl Commercials Super? (April 2020-present)
https://github.com/Wbates2012/SuperBowlCapstone
In an effort to analyze artistic style, I collected thousands of television commercials from the past decade with the goal of numerically learning the socially recognized distinction between Super Bowl commercials and commercials from the rest of the year. In the process of dissecting advertisements into raw audio and video features, we hope to contribute toward better understanding theatricality and sensationalism in marketing.

### Quantifying Abstraction in Piet Mondrian (January-March 2020)
https://github.com/Wbates2012/QuantifyingStyle
In another cultural analytics project, I considered Dutch artist Piet Mondrian's evolution from realism to abstraction from a numerical perspective. Building on research by Lev Manovich and Jason Bailey, I extracted and modelled intrinsic image features in order to assess the relationship between cultural phenomena and quantitative pattern recognition.

## Reports

### The Beatles in Numbers (May 2020)
https://github.com/ucsd-dsc-arts/dsc160-midterm-group16
In this team project, my group and I analyzed the music of The Beatles in a wide range of aspects. My specific work focused on comparing albums by The Beatles on scales of lyrical and musical complexity, as well as intrinsic sonic variety and distinctiveness.

### Airbnb in Amsterdam (April-June 2019)
https://github.com/Wbates2012/Projects/blob/master/Airbnb%20in%20Amsterdam.pdf
From a dataset of Airbnb listings in the city of Amsterdam, I employed extensive spatial analysis and visualization techniques to assess the fairness of listing prices based on amenities, geoenriched location data, and supply/demand analysis.

### Film Recommender (December 2019)
https://github.com/Wbates2012/Projects/blob/master/Movie_Recommender.pdf
This report descibes a recommender system using ML for movies based on features such as sentiment analysis, Jaccard similarity, and relative popularity.

### March Madness (March 2019)
https://github.com/Wbates2012/Projects/blob/master/Math%20189%20March%20Madness.pdf
From a Kaggle dataset of historic NCAA Women's March Madness tournament data, my team and I employed a variety of statistical analysis methods to gauge feature quality and make accurate predictions.

## Teaching Materials

### Introductory Python for Data Analysis (July 2019)
